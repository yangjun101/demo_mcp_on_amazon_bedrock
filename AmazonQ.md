# MCP Browser Automation Setup Guide

## Issue Resolution
The error you encountered was related to missing Playwright browser binaries. The error message indicated:
```
browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /Users/yangxjun/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1148/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

## Steps Taken to Fix the Issue

1. Modified the MCP browser automation configuration to use headless mode:
   ```typescript
   browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
   ```

2. Rebuilt the project:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/yangxjun/work/dev-code/mcp-browser-automation
   npm run build
   ```

3. Installed Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

## Using MCP Browser in Your Project

When adding the MCP browser server to your chatbot interface, make sure to use the correct path to the compiled JavaScript file:

```json
{ 
  "mcpServers": { 
    "mcp-browser": { 
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/Users/yangxjun/work/dev-code/mcp-browser-automation/dist/index.js"] 
    } 
  } 
}
```

## Headless Mode Benefits

Running the browser in headless mode:
- Reduces resource usage
- Works better in server environments
- Improves performance
- Avoids UI-related issues

The browser will still perform all the same operations but without displaying a visible window.
